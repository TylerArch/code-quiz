# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

# 02 Password Generator

## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a coding quiz to incorporate the new elements of JavaScript that I have learned. I incorporated loops, Event Listeners, Local Storage interaction, and dynamic object creation to accomplish this. I heavily expanded on my JavaScript funtionality and am very happy with the result.

## Installation

Right clicking on the index.html and selecting "Open in default browser" will open the browser and  navigate to the Portfolio page.

## Usage

Clicking the Start Quiz button a timer will begin and you will be prompted to select an answer to a coding question.  If you answer correctly a "Correct" alert is triggered and ten points are added to your score. If you answer incorrectly, five seconds are removed from the remaining time and an "incorrect" alert will be triggered.
The quiz ends when you have completed all the questions or time runs out.
A final page will indicate your score for the quiz and a text box appears if you would like to enter your initials to save your score. If you take the quiz multiple times your scores from previous quizes will be displayed.
